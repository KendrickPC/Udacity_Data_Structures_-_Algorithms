# Maps and Hashing

##### Hashing

	Using a data structure that uses a hashing function allows 
	you to do lookups in constant time. A lookup in a list or set
	has an efficiency in linear time.

	Stacks and queues lets you look up the oldest or newest 
	elements immediately, but if you want any other element, you've
	got to do a linear time search.

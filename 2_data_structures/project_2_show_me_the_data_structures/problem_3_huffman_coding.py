# PEP8 Verified
# Huffman Coding
'''
A Huffman code is a type of optimal prefix code that is used
for compressing data. The Huffman encoding and decoding schema
is also lossless, meaning that when compressing the data to
make it smaller, there is no loss of information.

The Huffman algorithm works by assigning codes that correspond
to the relative frequency of each character for each character.
The Huffman code can be of any length and does not require a
prefix; therefore, this binary code can be visualized on a binary
tree with each encoded character being stored on leafs.

There are many types of pseudocode for this algorithm.
At the basic core, it is comprised of building a Huffman tree,
encoding the data, and, lastly, decoding the data.

Here is one type of pseudocode for this coding schema:

    - Take a string and determine the relevant frequencies of
      the characters.
    - Build and sort a list of tuples from lowest to highest
      frequencies.
    - Build the Huffman Tree by assigning a binary code to each
      letter, using shorter codes for the more frequent letters.
      (This is the heart of the Huffman algorithm.)
    - Trim the Huffman Tree (remove the frequencies from the
      previously built tree).
    - Encode the text into its compressed form.
    - Decode the text from its compressed form.
    - create encoding, decoding, and sizing schemas.

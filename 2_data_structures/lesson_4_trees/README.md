# Trees

	A tree is just an extension of a linked list.
	
	Linked lists are often drawn horizontally, but a tree is
	often drawn vertically.

	Must not have unconnected nodes and must not have any
	cycles in a tree.


### Coding Practice Objectives:
	
##### Create a Binary Tree

	Traverse a Tree:
		* Depth first
		* Breadth first

	Binary Search Tree:
		* Insert
		* Search
		* Delete

	Average Time Complexity:
		* Tree --> log(n)
		Hint: When you think of trees, think of logs.  hehehe =)

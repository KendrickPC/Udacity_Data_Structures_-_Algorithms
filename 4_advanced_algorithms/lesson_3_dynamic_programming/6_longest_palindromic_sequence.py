# Longest Palindromic Subsequence
'''
In this notebook, you'll be tasked with finding the length of the
Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) given a string of characters.

As an example:

    * With an input string, ABBDBCACB
    * The LPS is BCACB, which has length = 5

In this notebook, we'll focus on finding an optimal solution to the
LPS task, using dynamic programming. There will be some similarities
to the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) task, which is outlined in
detail in a previous notebook. It is recommended that you start with
that notebook before trying out this task.

Hint¬∂
Storing pre-computed values

The LPS algorithm depends on looking at one string and comparing
letters to one another. Similar to how you compared two strings in
the LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) task, you can compare the
characters in just one string with one another, using a matrix to
store the results of matching characters.

For a string on length n characters, you can create an n x n matrix
to store the solution to subproblems. In this case, the subproblem
is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence, up to a certain
point in the string (up to the end of a certain substring).

It may be helpful to try filling up a matrix on paper before you start
your code solution. If you get stuck with this task, you may look at
some example matrices below (see the section titled Example matrices),
before consulting the complete solution code.

LPS length:  7
Note: The lower diagonal values will remain 0 in all cases.

The Matrix Rules:
You can efficiently fill up this matrix one cell at a time.
Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells
that are directly on bottom and to the left of it, or on the
diagonal/bottom-left. The rules are as follows:

    - Start with an n x n matrix where n is the number of characters
      in a given string; the diagonal should all have the value 1 for
      the base case, the rest can be zeros.
    - As you traverse your string:
        If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the
        bottom-left of that cell plus two.
    - If there is not a match, take the maximum value from either
        directly to the left or the bottom cell, and carry that value
        over to the non-match cell.
    - After completely filling the matrix, the top-right cell will
      hold the final LPS length.

# Complexity
'''
What was the complexity of this?

In the solution, we are looping over the elements of our input_string
using two for loops; these are each of  ùëÇ(ùëÅ)  and nested this
becomes  ùëÇ(ùëÅ^2) . This behavior dominates our optimized solution.

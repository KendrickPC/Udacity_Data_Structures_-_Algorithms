# Debrief

### Know the Company
	How many users does it currently have? Where does it rank against its competitors?
	Have any major publications (The New York Times, Bloomberg Business, Wired, etc.) covered the product or company’s growth and development?
	Are there any major glitches, bugs, or other technical flaws that have been reported and have gone unresolved?
	In your opinion, what are the best attributes of the product? What are things to be fixed or improved?


### Request an Informational Interview
	An initial email or longer LinkedIn message are two of the most common ways of extending a request for an informational interview. Consider the following when crafting your message:

	Your tone should be gracious; at no point should you assume that they are obligated to offer you their time or attention, regardless of how you know each other.
	Make sure that your email is concise and specific. For example, if you're hoping for a 20-minute phone call, you can say: "If you have time for a 20-minute phone call, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn more about the company."
	Sometimes, you will not get an immediate reply. The person could be on vacation or overwhelmed with messages.
	Be sure to allow enough time (up to 2 weeks) for a response. If they have not responded within a week, you can send one follow-up inquiry.
	If you aren’t able to schedule a live conversation, the contact may be still willing to answer some questions over email or LinkedIn.


### Ways to Connect

	Now you know how to reach out to someone for an informational interview! The two most likely ways for you to connect with someone is over email (you got their business card, or someone introduced you both) or over LinkedIn. Although email and LinkedIn are different platforms, the structure of how you reach out and start a conversation is the same. See the examples below.

	Sample Email Template
	Hi [Contact Name],

	1st Paragraph - Self introduction including the following information:

	Your career interests
	Reason for reaching out
	How contact’s position/background connects the first 2 pieces of information
	Your connection to the person you’re writing to, if there is any
	2nd Paragraph - Details on where, when, and how you would like to carry out the informational interview

	Sincerely,

	[Name]

	[LinkedIn profile URL -- make sure to set your privacy settings to public!]

	Don't forget: people like being reached out to! There's no reason to see your informational interview request as an inconvenience to the other person. Like you, other people are interested in improving professionally, which can revolve around sharing their own experiences and knowledge or discussing current topics of interest in the industry.

	Over time, you will become deeply familiar with conducting informational interviews. You may feel nervous or unsure at first, but with practice and frequent networking interactions, you will soon become a networking pro.

	We hope that you now feel equipped with the knowledge and confidence to successfully conduct an informational interview from start to finish.

	Good Luck!

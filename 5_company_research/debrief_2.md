Learn why some questions are unsuitable for an informational interview.
We hope you learned some new questions to ask in the informational interview from the Sample Questions Quiz. Next, we'd like to break down the reasons for why some of these questions are unsuitable for an informational interview and should be avoided. Also, we'll go over what you can ask instead!

Can you tell me about [x company controversy]?
Why not to ask: As an employee, it can be both uncomfortable and awkward for them to make public comments to you about such a sensitive topic. The purpose of this informational interview is for you to develop a rapport with a valuable professional connection.

What to ask instead: Rather than focusing on such a negative topic, steer the conversation toward your shared passions and professional interests. If it's absolutely necessary for you to address an area of concern, do so in a polite and constructive way by posing the question after you have developed a stronger rapport with them. For example, instead of framing the conversation as company gossip, approach the question from a more professional angle: "After doing research on your company, I noticed some comments on Glassdoor about [x issue]. Would you be able to shed some light on my concerns regarding these comments?"

How much do you make?
Why not to ask: It’s normal to be curious about such a topic, especially since you will have your own expectations around the salary for a position you're interested in. However, this can be an inappropriate, private question to ask, especially the first time you meet.

What to ask instead: If you wish to collect information on this topic, try posing a more general question to gauge the industry’s expected salary range for a position. Furthermore, don't forget to do some research on websites like Paysa, which provides market salary data, to see if you can find a reliable answer on your own.

Can I add you on Facebook?
Why not to ask: You may find yourself developing a great connection with whomever you’re interviewing, but remember that you should keep the exchange professional. Furthermore, they may be hesitant about connecting on a social platform with someone who contacted them with inquiries about their professional experience and career advice.

What to ask instead: If you’d like to maintain friendly but professional contact with them, politely ask if you can add them on LinkedIn (if you haven’t already).

What other roles have you worked in?
Why not to ask: This seems like a suitable question, but should actually be avoided because you should already know the answer! As part of your interview preparation, you’ll inevitably look up information on the interviewee’s work history via their LinkedIn profile. Remember, you want to spend the precious amount of time you have for this interview on getting answers to questions that you would not be able to find online.

What to ask instead: If you wish to learn more about a certain aspect of their work experience, try preparing questions that show you've done your research and have put much thought into what you want to discuss with them. For example, "I see you've worked at [this company]. Why did you decide to switch jobs?"

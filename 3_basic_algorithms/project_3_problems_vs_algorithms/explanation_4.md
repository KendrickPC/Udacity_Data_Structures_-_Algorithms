# Problem 4

### Dutch National Flag Problem
I begin solving this problem with setting the low and middle variables to
zero. The high variable is set to the length of the input list.

Since the objective is to create a sort through a single traversal, I set
a while loop condition - the middle must be equal to or less my high variable.

 while loop for the condition mid is less than or equal to high if list[mid] is zero swap list[low] and list[mid] and also increment the lo+ and mid+ else if list[mid] is one increment the mid else list[mid] is blue we should then swap the list[mid] and list[high] also decrement the high value high--

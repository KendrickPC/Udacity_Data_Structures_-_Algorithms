# Max and Min in an Unsorted Array

The task at hand is to find the maximum and minimum values from
an unsorted array without using any python libraries to sort 
the array.

Another focus is to traverse our array with a single traversal - 
I use two placeholders represented as maximum and minimum.

### Time and Space complexity
In this case, we perform a single transverse of the whole input,
being the time complexity of O(n). In respect to the space complexity,
we have just a pair of pointers, hence, it is independent from
input size; O(1).

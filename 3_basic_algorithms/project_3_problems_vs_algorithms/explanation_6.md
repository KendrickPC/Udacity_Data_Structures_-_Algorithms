# Max and Min in an Unsorted Array
The task at hand is to find the maximum and minimum values from
an unsorted array without using any python libraries to sort 
the array.

Another focus is to traverse our array with a single traversal - 
I use two placeholders represented as maximum and minimum.

### Time Complexity
For a single traversal of the array, the time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm requires pairing the maximum
and minimum pointers. This requirement is independent for the size 
of our input array. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1)

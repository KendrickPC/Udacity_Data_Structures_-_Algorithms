Heaps: 

A heap is another specific type of tree with some of its
own additional rules.

In a heap, elements are arranged in increasing or 
decreasing order; the root element is either the 
maximum or minimum value in the tree.

Basically, there are two different types of heaps:
max heaps and min heaps.

Heaps don't need to be binary trees, so parents can have
any arbitrary number of children.

Searches usually happen in O(n) time complexity for 
worst case (linear time).

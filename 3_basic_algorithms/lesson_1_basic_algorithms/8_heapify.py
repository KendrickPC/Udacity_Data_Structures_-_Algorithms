Heapify:

Adding and deleting elements into a heap require the
new element to be placed in the empty slot, then the
element is compared to the parent node and
reorganized - this is called the 'heapify' process.


Worst Case Efficiency is O(log(n))
because it is based on the size of the tree (moving 
an element all the way up or down the tree).

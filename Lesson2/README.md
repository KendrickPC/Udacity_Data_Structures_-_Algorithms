# Data Structures

## Arrays and Linked Lists

### Collections
	- Collections don't have a particular order (so you can't say "give me the 3rd
	element in this collection").
	- Collections don't have to have objects of the same type.

### Lists
	- Lists have an order (so you can say things like "give me the 3rd
	  item in the list").
	- Lists have no fixed length (you can add or remove elements).

### Arrays
	- Python lists are essentially arrays, but also include additional
	  high-level functionality
